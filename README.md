# FlashCards
FlashCard generator for learning a foreign language.
This app generates FlashCards for learning vocabulary in a foreign language. It generates a PDF file in A4 format in which words in language_1 are put on even pages, and words in language_2 are placed on the odd pages. **This PDF must be double-sided printed!** To correct work this app needs two extra files: spreadsheet in .csv format (with comma separator), font file in .ttf format. The font file is responsible for font on flashcards (thanks to this you can use a font with Chinese or Greek letters to learn those languages).

**To propper work this app needs:**
- **flash_card.py** or **flash_card.exe** file
- **data.csv** file with vocabulary (with 2 columns i.e. in 1'st column Polish words, in 2'nd column English words
- **font.ttf** file with a font which you want on your flashcards

Note: Example font.ttf and data.csv are included in the project
